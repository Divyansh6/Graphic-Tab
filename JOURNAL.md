## 10/27/2025 - It's Showtime?  

IST 14:08 : Just made this project
IST 14:15 : Found Patchouli, an open source graphic tablet project and works using some... EMR thing?
IST 14:30 : Okay so i watched "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igVscvWAR1s" for some enlightenment and am still lost. Time for Grok to do some explaining
IST 15:07 : OK so the board(PCB) has many copper paths that carry current and the current generates a magnetic field of certain frequency, then the stylus catches that frequency through a induction system and induces the micro currents into the coil network and the stm chip does some fancy stuff to determine the location of stylus(i don't even know what i am typing)

OK, to simplify, just use the board schematics from the Patchouli project to make your own and use ai to help you with how to make the LC circuit for the stylus
