## 10/27/2025 - It's Showtime?  

IST 14:08 : Just made this project
IST 14:15 : Found Patchouli, an open source graphic tablet project and works using some... EMR thing?
IST 14:30 : Okay so i watched "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igVscvWAR1s" for some enlightenment and am still lost. Time for Grok to do some explaining
IST 15:07 : OK so the board(PCB) has many copper paths that carry current and the current generates a magnetic field of certain frequency, then the stylus catches that frequency through a induction system and induces the micro currents into the coil network and the stm chip does some fancy stuff to determine the location of stylus(i don't even know what i am typing)

OK, to simplify, just use the board schematics from the Patchouli project to make your own and use ai to help you with how to make the LC circuit for the stylus

## 11/5/2025 - Found Documentation and Studied It  

schedule's been rough lately (exams)
anyways i went back to the video and noticed there is a documentation for this (i was gonna lose it) which explained everything in pretty good way, 
here is the link ==> https://patchouli.readthedocs.io/en/latest
So basically when the stylus receives the frequencies, they get induced by a solenoid like structure in the stylus to get small electric currents which when flow into the board help magnify the waves in that region which is triangulated by the chip after a bit of amplification and BOOM!!! Location is calculated and sent through the cable. 
To sense clicks, the tip of the stylus is push able and connected to a variable capacitor which helps in altering the frequency signals emitted by it which is also understood by the chip.
The Diagram for the board is attached below,
